# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a web-based visualization tool for pathfinding algorithms. It allows users to visualize how algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) find the shortest path between two points on a grid, avoiding obstacles.

## Features

*   **Interactive Grid:** Create and modify the grid of nodes.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose between different pathfinding algorithms (DFS and BFS).
*   **Set Start and End Points:** Define the starting and ending nodes for the pathfinding.
*   **Obstacle Creation:** Add obstacles to the grid to challenge the algorithms.
*   **Maze Generation:** Generate a random maze.
*   **Real-time Visualization:** Watch the algorithms explore the grid in real-time.
*   **Reset Functionality:** Easily reset the grid to its initial state.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username_/pathfinder-viz.git
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Select an Algorithm:** Choose either DFS or BFS from the menu.
2.  **Set Start and End Points:** Click on the "Set Start" and "Set End" buttons and then click on the grid to place the start and end nodes.
3.  **Add Obstacles:** Click on the "Set Obstacles" button and click on the grid to add obstacles.
4.  **Generate a Maze:** Click on the "Maze" button to generate a random maze.
5.  **Run the Visualization:** Click the "Run" button to see the algorithm in action.
6.  **Reset:** Click the "Reset" button to clear the grid.
